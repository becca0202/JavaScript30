# JavaScript30

I wanted to participate in this challenge as a way to refresh my vanilla JS skills after spending bootcamp playing with layers and layers of libraries and frameworks. So far I'm finding it to be a fun and quick way to test my knowledge on CSS, JS and DOM manipulation. If you want to give it a try, head over to try [JavaScript30 from WesBos](https://javascript30.com/)!
